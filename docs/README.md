How to render UML
- PlantUML (.puml)
  - Use any PlantUML renderer (local docker, IntelliJ/VSCode plugins, or https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/).
  - Example CLI: docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/data plantuml/plantuml -tsvg docs/uml-class-diagram.puml
- Mermaid (.mmd)
  - Many Git platforms render Mermaid automatically.
  - You can also use the Mermaid Live Editor: https://mermaid.live/

Contributing to docs
- Keep files small and focused; link back to this README for navigation.
- When adding new services, update the UML diagram(s) and the relevant sections of architecture.md and technical-overview.md.
